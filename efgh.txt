Stop being who you were and become who you are. Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose - and commit myself to - what is best for me. When someone leaves, its because someone else is about to arrive- I'll find love again. The wise are wise only because they love.
When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.
One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.
So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.
Don't waste your time with explanations: people only hear what they want to hear.
Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.
Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.
Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream.
